Monarch Monarchy is an app to view monarch butterfly sighting data - spring season only from 2016 to present - and to record personal sightings. Monarch sighting data is graciously scraped from www.journeynorth.com.

This code is a test iteration of Bootstrap on top of existing Javascript and HTML from the original app.
